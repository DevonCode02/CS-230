# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room needed help in the development of a game called Draw it or Lose it. This game is a team game where the teams try to guess the image that is being slowly displayed on the screen. They have a time limit for one of the teams make a guess and if a team guesses incorrectly or runs out of time then the other teams get a chance to guess. The Gaming Room needed me to design the software for the game setup including the the code for the game, game library, players, and teams and how these are all connected.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe my comparison of the various operating platforms was done well. I put a lot of time into researching the pros and cons of development using each platform. This included the cost and time involved in developing using each different platform.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The UML Diagram and domain model sections of the documentation were very helpful in development of the code. This section and the diagram allowed me to grasp the complete requirements for the software I had to develop.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one section of the document to revise it would be the final recommendation section. I didnt get to put as much effort into that section as I would have liked.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by carefully reading the prompt that was given to us for the software requirements. It layed out specific requirements for the code for this game. I also reviewed the UML diagram several times to ensure that I was implementing all of the features that the Gaming Room required.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing the software by following the task log that had a list of all of the "FIXME"s in the code that was provided for us. Then I read the prompt and reviewed the UML diagram to see all of the requirements that werent covered in the task log.
